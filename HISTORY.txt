- Leave umask alone. If it must be set for service deployment, we'd better
  resort to .bashrc or similar.

==================

- `self.config_attr('attribute', 'list')` syntax for list-valued types in
  configuration files.
- Call `setlocale` at batou-local startup to initialize locale settings
  throughout component execution.


0.1.1 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Add support for global find-links in Buildout. If a secret
  [buildout]find-links is found, it will be put in component.find_links.


0.1p2 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Packaging fix: include test fixtures to enable running tests on
  installed eggs.


0.1p1 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Correct packaging bugs: missing .txt files etc.
