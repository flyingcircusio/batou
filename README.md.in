batou helps you to automate your application deployments:

* You create a model of your deployment using a simple but powerful Python API.
* You configure how the model applies to hosts in different environments.
* You verify and run the deployment with the batou utility.

Getting started with a new project is easy:

```console
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingcircusio/batou/master/appenv.py -o batou
$ chmod +x batou
$ ./batou
```

Here's a minimal application model:

```console
$ mkdir -p components/myapp
$ cat > components/myapp/component.py
from batou.component import Component
from batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Package
from batou.lib.supervisor import Program

    class MyApp(Component):

        def configure(self):
            venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
            self += venv
            venv += Package('myapp')
            self += Program('myapp',
                command='bin/myapp')
```

And here's a minimal environment:

```console
$ mkdir environments
$ cat > environments/dev.cfg
[environment]
connect_method = local

[hosts]
localhost = myapp
```

To deploy this, you run:

```console
$ ./batou deploy dev
```

Check the [detailed documentation](http://batou.readthedocs.org) to get going with a more ambitious project.


## Features

* Separate your application model from environments
* Supports idempotent operation for incremental deployments
* Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously
* Automated dependency resolution for multi-host
  scenarios
* No runtime requirements on your application
* Encrypted secrets with multiple access levels: store your
  SSL certificates, SSH keys, service secrets and more to get true 1-button deployments.
* Deploy to local machines, Vagrant, or any SSH host
* Broad SSH feature support by using OpenSSH through execnet
* Only few dependencies required on the remote host
* Ships with a library of components for regularly needed
  tasks
* self-bootstrapping and self-updating - no additional
  scripting needed
