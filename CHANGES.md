## Changelog


### 2.0b3 (unreleased)

- Improve error message in case of a DNS error during address resolution


### 2.0b2 (2019-10-15)

#### General

- Make encryption/decryption error prompt more readable.

- Fix coding style issues.

#### Features

- Add coarse grained parallelization of deployments.

  Using asyncio we now schedule rooot components for deployment as soon as all
  their dependencies are completed. However, due to execnet being synchronous
  this only has a visible effect for components on  multiple hosts. This will
  speed up long running multi-host deployments.

  In the future this will become more fine-grained so that we can even deploy
  multiple independent components on the same host in parallel.

#### Bugs

- Fix issue #5: allow using % in secrets similar to regular overrides.

- Fix secrets editing, add test coverage for the affected code.

#### Testing

- Relax global pytest timeouts to avoid slow network failures.

- Switch from broken/abandoned pytest-codecheckers to pytest-flake8

- Enable flake8, remove unused pytest markers.

- Fix warnings

- Make warnings errors.

#### Build system / Development environment

- Update example batou scripts

- Fix travis build environments. Support Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8-dev and
  nightly (also 3.8 currently).

- Generalize development bootstrapping code for dual use in local and travis environments.


### 2.0b1 (2019-10-11)

- Drop support for Python 2.

- Move to Python 3.5+.

  A smooth migration mechanism may become available in the future
  based on users' needs.

- The default hash function is now 'sha256', existing deployments
  need to be migrated manually.
