Sometimes, a component is shared as a subcomponent by multiple parents. In
such cases, it may be unhelpful to deploy the subcomponent along with each
parent, which would be what ordinarily happens in a batou run.

One example of this is a VCS clone that contributes as additional
configuration to multiple buildouts (implying that it is added to each as a
subcomponent). Deploying the VCS clone as part of each buildout's deployment
is not desirable: Verifying and updating the VCS clone incurs network access,
which is expensive in terms of performance, and any deployment after the first
either makes no change to the working directory or, if it does, may apply a
change that conflicts with some previously completed buildouts using the
clone.

Therefore, the ``batou.component.deploy_once`` class decorator may be applied
to a component that should not be deployed more than once per host during any
given batou run. The decorator is already applied to
``batou.lib.mercurial.Clone``.
