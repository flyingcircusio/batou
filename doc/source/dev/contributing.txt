Contributor's guide
===================

If you’re reading this you’re probably interested in contributing to batou.
First, we’d like to say: thank you! Open source projects live-and-die based on
the support they receive from others, and the fact that you’re even considering
supporting batou is very generous of you.

This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to batou. If
you’re thinking of contributing, start by reading this thoroughly and getting a
feel for how contributing to the project works. If you have any questions, feel
free to reach out to Christian Theune, the primary maintainer.

The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution you’re
thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines for all
contributors.

All Contributions
-----------------

Be Cordial
~~~~~~~~~~

Be cordial or be on your way.

batou has adopted this very important rule from the
`Requests <python-requests.org>`_ library. This rule governs all forms of
contribution, including reporting bugs or requesting features. This golden
rule is `be cordial or be on your way
<http://kennethreitz.org/be-cordial-or-be-on-your-way/>`_. **All contributions
are welcome**, as long as everyone involved is treated with respect.

Get Early Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until
it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to
seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished
version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of
getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work
into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.

Contribution Suitability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project maintainer has the last word on whether or not a contribution is
suitable for batou. All contributions will be considered, but from time to
time contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the project.

If your contribution is rejected, don’t despair! So long as you followed these
guidelines, you’ll have a much better chance of getting your next contribution
accepted.


Code Contributions
------------------

When contributing code, you’ll want to follow this checklist:

1. Fork the repository on
   `GitHub <https://github.com/flyingcircusio/batou>`_.
2. Run the tests to confirm they all pass on your system. If they don’t,
   you’ll need to investigate why they fail. If you’re unable to diagnose
   this yourself, raise it as a bug report by following the guidelines in
   this document.
3. Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
   Make your change.
4. Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass including
   the ones you just added.
5. Send a Pull Request to the main repository’s master branch. Pull Requests
   are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

The following sub-sections go into more detail on some of the points above.

Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributions will not be merged until they’ve been code reviewed. You should
implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it. In the
event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case
clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply,
you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution.

New Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are new or relatively new to Open Source, welcome! batou aims to be a
gentle introduction to the world of Open Source. If you’re concerned about how
best to contribute, please consider mailing a maintainer (listed above) and
asking for help.

Please also check the "Get Early Feedback" section.

Documentation Contributions
---------------------------

Documentation improvements are always welcome! The documentation files live in
the ``doc/`` directory of the codebase. They’re written in reStructuredText,
and use Sphinx to generate the full suite of documentation.

When contributing documentation, please attempt to follow the style of the
documentation files. This means a soft-limit of 79 characters wide in your text
files and a semi-formal prose style.

Bug Reports
-----------

Bug reports are hugely important! Before you raise one, though, please check
through the bugtracker issues, both open and closed, to confirm that the bug
hasn’t been reported before. Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time
of other contributors, and should be avoided as much as possible.

When reporting a bug, make sure to include the batou version and platform
identifier, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./batou
    batou/2.3b2.dev0 (cpython 3.9.5-final0, Darwin 20.5.0 x86_64)
    ...

Also, include console output, relevant component code and maybe environment
configuration if reporting errors.

Feature Requests
----------------

batou is under development. We have a strong idea about our architecture,
though.

If you believe there is a feature missing, feel free to raise a feature
request, but please demonstrate the issue you want to solve instead of
only suggesting a certain function or feature. We want batou's architecture
to remain as small and clean as possible and thus we're heavily interested
in understanding the problem you are trying to solve.


Code of Conduct
---------------

Our Pledge
~~~~~~~~~~

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

Our Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Our Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
~~~~~

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at mail@flyingcircus.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

Attribution
~~~~~~~~~~~

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
