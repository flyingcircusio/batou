Services are defined by describing the components they are made up of as
Python code that will be run during a deployment and by specifying the
environments in which the components will be deployed.

Batou gives you a structure for arranging your components and a library that
makes it easy to write components.

Component definition
--------------------

Components are pieces of software whose configuration depends on the
environment and host their are configured on as well as the configuration of
other components.

Here's a component that touches a file::

  class Touch(Component):
     @step(1)
     def touch(self):
        self.cmd('touch /tmp/asdf')

Environments
------------

Environments provide configuration to components and select which components
should be installed on which hosts.

Here's an environment definition that would be suitable for development::

   [hosts]
   localhost = touch


Deploying a service
===================


Locally
-------

You can deploy any configuration locally that you want. In the most simple
case you select your devel



Remotely
--------




In-depth
========

The sizing of a component depends on two factors: coherence and distribution.
If some software is always build together and/or shares a lot of build code,
it should be a single component or depend on a shared component. If software
needs to be run on different hosts independently it should be split in
multiple components or make use "features" to control partial configurations
with shared code.
