Upgrading
=========

Generally batou tries to be *very* friendly when upgrading from version to
version so you don't have to unnecessarily change your deployments. We try to
introduce new features without breaking existing semantics.

batou 1.x to batou 2.x
======================

This upgrade mainly consists of a switch from Python 2 to Python 3 but it also
does include a few details about how things are handled.

Major changes
-------------

* batou requires at least Python 3.5, anything newer is fine, too.

* File changes now show (expected) diffs.

* You can deploy to multiple hosts at once using the `-j` option or the `jobs`
  option in the environment configuration.

* Secrets can now also override `data-` sections for hosts.

* You can now use `assert` instead of `raise UpdateNeeded` in the `verify`
  methods.

* The embedded supervisor has been updated.

Updating your deployment
------------------------

The following steps assume that you have cloned and checked out your deployment
and it is your current working directory.

.. code-block:: console

	$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingcircusio/batou/master/bootstrap | sh

The generated lockfile `requirements.lock` might not pick up all versions of all
packages correctly (for example packages taken directly from source control will
fail) so you might want to doublecheck those and massage the lockfile in case
that this fails with something like:

.. code-block:: console

	ERROR: No matching distribution found for batou-ext==0.1.dev0 (from -r .batou/16f85f2d/requirements.lock (line 3))

.. note:: `batou_ext` will be updated automatically to a proper Python 3 version
  and syntax.

At this point you can now update your projects' component code to Python 3:

.. code-block:: console

	$ 2to3 -w components

After this you need to run batou in your development environment to see whether
any further changes may be needed.

Things you may have to change in your deployment
------------------------------------------------

* Add `sensitive_data=True` to files that may contain sensitive data and whose
  content you do not want to see in any logs. This suppresses diff generation.

* The default hash function has been changed to `sha512` and thus existing
  hashes relying on the default being md5 will fail.


Updating to a newer batou 2.x version
=====================================

After having switched from batou 1.x to 2.x you might update to the latest
``batou`` release once in a while. This requires the following steps:

* Edit ``requirements.txt`` and enter the desired version: ``batou==2.x``.

    - If you want to use an unreleased version use a git URL like this:
      ``-e git+https://github.com/flyingcircusio/batou.git#egg=batou`` instead
      of the ``batou==2.x`` requirement.
* Run ``./batou appenv-update-lockfile`` to update ``requirements.lock``.
* Commit the changes and run ``batou`` so it can update itself to the new
  version.
