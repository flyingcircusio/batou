Managing files and directories
------------------------------

Files and Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The File component has been developed with `Puppet`_'s file type in mind. It
accepts a very similar parameter set and has almost identical features.

You can use it to manage files, directories, and symlinks, and you can specify
content (literally or as Jinja templates). You can also manage the Unix
attributes and control whether leading directories should be managed or not.

.. _`Puppet`: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/

The most basic usage is simply:

.. code-block:: python

    self += File('myfile')

This example creates a file at ``work/mycomponent/myfile``, taking the contents
from a file of the same name in the component's directory (i.e.
``components/mycomponent/myfile``). By default, the source file is run through
Jinja, with the file's parent component made available as ``component``.


.. py:class:: batou.lib.file.File(path)

Creates a file. The main parameter for File is the target path. A ``File`` instance has an attribute ``path`` containing the full, absolute path to the resulting file.

``File`` accepts the following additional parameters:

.. py:attribute:: source

   Filename of the source file to be used as the File's content
   (absolute path or relative to the component's directory).
   [Default: same as target path]

.. py:attribute:: content

    Literal file contents as a string.

.. py:attribute:: is_template

    Process file contents as Jinja template. [Default: True]

.. py:attribute:: template_context

    Object to make available as ``component`` to the Jinja template.
    [Default: File's parent component]

.. py:attribute:: template_args

    Dict of additional arguments to make available to the Jinja template.

.. py:attribute:: encoding

    Encoding for the file contents [Default: utf-8]

.. py:attribute:: owner

    Unix owner username.

.. py:attribute:: group

    Unix group name.

.. py:attribute:: mode

    Unix permission mode. Can be given as an integer value (`0o755`) or as an octal integer string (`'755'`) or as a unix mode string similar to the output of `ls -l` (`'rwx--x--x'`).

.. py:attribute:: leading

    Create leading directories that were given in the target ``path``.
    [Default: False]

.. py:attribute:: ensure

    Type of object to be created: 'file', 'directory', or 'symlink'.
    This is useful for complex situations (e.g. creating a symlink with
    special ownership), for simple situations it's probably more readable
    to use :py:class:`Directory` or :py:class:`Symlink`.

.. py:attribute:: link_to

    Source of symlink (for :py:attr:`ensure` = 'symlink')

.. py:attribute:: sensitive_data

    Mark a file as sensitive so its content is not exposed by the
    (diff-)output of batou. This is useful in situations where the
    rendered file contains a password or other sensitive data.
    [Default: False]

.. py:class:: batou.lib.file.BinaryFile(path)

Subclass of batou.lib.file.File. Creates a non-template binary file.


.. _file-directory:

Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: batou.lib.file.Directory(path)

    Creates a directory. The main parameter is the target path.

.. py:attribute:: source

    Path to a source directory whose contents are to be synchronized to the
    target path (uses rsync internally).

.. py:attribute:: exclude

    List of file names or patterns that should **not** be synchronized to the
    target path (passed to rsync as ``--exclude`` argument, see the `rsync
    documentation`_ for details).

.. _`rsync documentation`: https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html


.. py:class:: Symlink(target, source)

    Creates a symlink at ``target`` by linking to ``source``.


Removing files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removal of obsolete things is a difficult topic in the convergence paradigm. If
in the past we created a file ``foo``, but now it is not used anymore, the code
that originally said, "please manage ``foo``", will not be there anymore. This
means that nobody knows that the file ``foo`` that is still lying around on the
production system is not actually in use anymore. In most cases, a few stray
files do not matter, but in case they do, the deployment code has to explicitly
state that something should **not** be present anymore.

.. py:class:: batou.lib.file.Purge(pattern)

    Ensures that a set of files (given as a glob pattern) does not exist.


.. _file-extract:

Extracting archive files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

batou can extract archive files in Tar, Zip, and DMG (on OSX target machines)
format:

.. py:class:: batou.lib.archive.Extract(archive)

The main parameter is the archive filename (relative to the component's
directory). The archive format is determined according to the file name
extension ('.tar', '.tar.gz', '.tgz', '.tar.bz2', '.tar.xz' use ``tar``,
'.zip' uses ``unzip`` and '.dmg' uses ``hdiutil``). The following additional
parameters are supported:

.. py:attribute:: target

    Target directory to extract the archive into. Directory is created if
    it does not exist (compare :py:attr:`create_target_dir`).
    [Default: base name of the archive file]

.. py:attribute:: create_target_dir

    Extract into the directory given in :py:attr:`target`. Set to False to
    extract directly into the work directory.
    [Default: True]

.. py:attribute:: strip

    Only for tar archives: number of directories contained in the archive to
    strip off (see the `tar documentation`_ for details) [Default: 0]
