Managing python installations
-----------------------------

virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~

The basic building block for Python-based components is creation of virtualenvs
(to separate package installations from each other):

.. code-block:: python

    self += VirtualEnv('2.7')


.. py:class:: batou.lib.python.VirtualEnv(version)

    Creates a virtualenv for the given Python version in the working directory
    of the parent component. (Requires that ``pythonX.Y`` is in the ``PATH``)

.. py:attribute:: executable

    Full path to the Python executable to create the virtualenv for (default: ``pythonX.Y`` based on the version attribute).

batou downloads a compatible version of  `virtualenv`_ (depending on the Python
version you need) to ensure everything works as expected and to avoid problems
with incompatibilities or unexpected behaviours of whatever version might be
installed already on the system. (virtualenv base installations are shared by
all components for creating new virtualenvs, it is installed to
``work/.virtualenv``).

.. _`virtualenv`: http://virtualenv.org/


Installing packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python packages are installed from a package index such as `PyPI`_. batou uses
`pip`_ or easy_install for this purpose (but that actually is an implementation detail and depends on the specifics of the Python and virtualenv version).

Packages must be added to a virtual environment.

.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.python.org/
.. _`pip`: http://www.pip-installer.org/

.. code-block:: python

    venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
    self += venv
    venv += Package('Sphinx', version='1.1.3')


.. py:class:: batou.lib.python.Package(package)

    Install the Python package with the given name into the virtualenv of the
    parent component. Using :py:class:`Package` requires that it is
    added to a :py:class:`~batou.lib.python.VirtualEnv` instance.

.. py:attribute:: version

    The version of the package to install (**required**).

.. py:attribute:: install_options

    List of options that are passed to pip/easy_install on the command line.

    [Default: depends on the Python/virtualenv version in use]

.. py:attribute:: check_package_is_module

    Verify that the package is installed by trying to ``import`` it (more
    precisely, the first component of its dotted name). This is a stopgap
    against https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3, but should be pretty safe to
    disable if it causes trouble for specific packages (``distribute`` is a
    notable example, since it installs a Python module named ``setuptools``).

    [Default: True]

.. py:attribute:: timeout

    A timeout (in seconds) that the installer should use to limit stalling
    network activity.

    Only works when using ``pip``.

    [Default: equal to the environment's timeout setting]

.. py:attribute:: dependencies

    Whether only the package itself or its dependencies should be installed.

    [Default: True]


zc.buildout
~~~~~~~~~~~

batou has in-depth support for managing installations that use buildout. It
automatically wraps them in a virtualenv, installs the appropriate buildout
version, and takes care of running buildout whenever changes to configuration
files makes it necessary. A typical usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    self += Buildout(python='2.7', version='2.2', setuptools='1.0',
                     additional_config=[Directory('profiles', source='profiles')])

.. py:class:: batou.lib.buildout.Buildout()

    Manage a buildout installation

.. py:attribute:: python

    Python version (**required**)

.. py:attribute:: executable

    Full path to the python executable to create the virtualenv for (used
    instead of ``pythonX.Y``).

.. py:attribute:: version

    Version of zc.buildout to install (**required**)

.. py:attribute:: setuptools

    Version of setuptools to install into the virtualenv (must be appropriate
    to the buildout version, e.g. since 2.2 buildout requires setuptools, but
    some versions before that required distribute) (**required**)

.. py:attribute:: distribute

    Version of distribute to install into the virtualenv. Mutually exclusive
    with :py:attr:`setuptools`, of course.

.. py:attribute:: config

    If a different configuration file name than ``buildout.cfg`` should be used,
    pass in a :py:attr:`~batou.lib.file.File` or :py:attr:`Component` instance.

.. py:attribute:: additional_config

    Optional list of component instances (e.g. :py:attr:`~batou.lib.file.File`
    or :py:attr:`~batou.lib.file.Directory`) that contain further configuration
    files (so :py:attr:`~batou.lib.buildout.Buildout` knows when running
    buildout is needed).
