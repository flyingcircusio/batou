Timeout
-------

Environments can specify a timeout (in seconds) to be used when running a deployment.
batou's internal functions pass this on to various calls like 'pip',
'buildout', etc.

Component authors are advised to reference this variable as a
default for their own timeout parameters.

Can be overriden during deployment by specifying '--timeout=X' for the 'local'
and 'remote' commands.
