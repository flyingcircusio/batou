Motivation
----------

The operations team at gocept runs web applications. Service deployment
(read: installing and updating those applications) is a major task for us that
we think about a lot.

Nowadays we consider service deployments to target a "platform" instead of
"servers": provisioning and system configuration are solved well by other
tools. Also, developers should not have to think about "buying that server"
when coming up with their requirements for the target runtime environment.

A platform, for us, means that we can rely on machines, the operating system,
and other basic infrastructure to be already available.

There are grey areas between provisioning, system configuration, and service
deployment. That's why a deployment tool should have some flexibility to adapt
depending on the platform that a service uses.

A typical (web) project consists of many components that make up the runtime
environment, the application itself being only one of them. An example of a
project that we typically deal with looks like this:

.. image:: production-architecture.png
    :width: 400px

This "environment" consists of 27 virtual machines running a good number of
runtime components that need to be configured. The actual application (in this
case a Plone site running in a Zope server) is only one moving part of many.

The diagram only shows the active components that need to be configured. Many
more are "passive" and not visible here: maintenance jobs, secrets, process
supervision, log rotation, monitoring ... 

All of those components require hard-earned knowledge to configure them
properly – which is why we want to re-use this knowledge as much as possible.
For example, we rely on the knowledge of system administrators by letting them
pre-install, larger things like PostgreSQL and take care of their maintenance.
Deploying the service then only requires us to create the database and user.
Another example is nginx: we also want to benefit from a system-installed
package but need to add our own virtual host definitions and need to be able to
reload the process with user privileges.

When running a service like the above, you typically also want to run a copy
for testing purposes. The testing environment will be structurally similar but
should use less resources to minimze cost:

.. image:: staging-architecture.png
    :width: 400px

We further see that there are even more circumstances that need their own
environments, such as developers running the application (or some part of it)
on their own machine.

.. image:: dev-architecture.png
    :width: 400px

In addition to these environments we need to ponder that:

* we need more development environments when new developers arrive,
* we need to merge changes to the config to all of the environments,
* we need to consider both initial installation and sub-sequent updates.

These are the basic requirements that led us to developing batou.

Name
----

The name "batou" is taken from the animated movie "Ghost in the Shell". Batou
is a member of the police force hunting down the "puppet master".

We chose the name as a pun on the fact that we have a history with and are
happy users of `Puppet <http://puppetlabs.com>`_ but were also looking for a
complementary tool.

History
-------

Looking back we see that there's a long history of automating deployments:

* FTPing PHP scripts from a developer machine to a server (late nineties)
* Running shell scripts to automate Zope instance configuration (2001)
* Using Zope's built-in instance configuration mechanism and more shell scripts (2003)
* Using zc.buildout to automate Python environment configuration (2006)
* Using Fabric to automate zc.buildout deployment (2010)

Around 2008 we started making operations a major part of our business. In 2010
we got a big customer for whom we needed all the setup that is shown in the
diagrams above and started thinking harder about automating this deployment
properly.

On the system configuration level we were already using puppet. However, system
configuration and service deployment are two different animals: with puppet we
manage many machines that are similar (system configuration) whereas the
service deployment wants to individualize some of those machines for a specific
purpose.

Comparison with other tools
---------------------------

**Puppet** is a system configuration tool and thus is designed around
assumptions that are detrimental to the goals of service deployment: no
orchestration, pull principle, root access. Also: check out Puppet Labs' `Fully
automated provisioning
<http://www.puppetlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FullyAutomatedProvisioning_Whitepaper7.pdf>`_
whitepaper which explicitly points to tools like Fabric, Capistrano,
ControlTier and others.

**Fabric + zc.buildout** was our basis when we started automating complex
setups. We used it to check out a Mercurial repository that contains a
buildout definition, run buildout on it, and do some additional shell stuff
around it. Give that to a list of hosts and you're good. We encountered two
substantial problems with this approach, though: we ended up with a single
large buildout and pretty complex Fabric code, both of which became
unmaintainable after a while. However, in general we did have a "single
command" deployment that worked very well – most of the time.

What we were missing was the declarative modelling that we enjoyed with Puppet
on the system configuration level. Also, we wanted to be able to do more
fine-grained deployment and not be limited to a "per host" command execution
order.

**Salt** seems to try solving the same problem as Fabric and MCollective: a
scalable approach to Remote Command Execution. We have not looked deeply at
Salt and it might be an interesting alternative to batou's SSH + Mercurial
usage. However, it seems to require additional runtime components in the target
environment which are not as widely available as SSH.


Architecture
------------

Batou consists of:

* a model to describe services in terms of "components" and "environments"
* a utility to realize a specific configuration locally (``batou-local``)
* a utility to deploy a whole environment remotely (``batou-remote``)
* an extensible library of re-usable components

Components are Python objects with an API to construct a component hierarchy
(making the model recursive) as well as to perform actions on the target system in
a manner that makes it easy to achieve convergency and idempotency.

Environments represent different installations of a service: staging,
production, development, etc. For each environment you specify which hosts belong
to it, how the services shall be distributed over those hosts, and possibly some
customization of how components are configured in that environment.

The ``batou-local`` utility deploys a given configuration (for a given host
and environment) locally.

The ``batou-remote`` utility deploys a given configuration for a complete
environment. It does so by bootstrapping itself using SSH and Mercurial and
then running ``batou-local`` on the remote side in  batch mode. It is able to
coordinate the execution order of tasks between different hosts as required by
the model.
