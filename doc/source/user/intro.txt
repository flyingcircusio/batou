Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

batou was developed with a number of ideas in mind:

* Deploying should always be just a single command.
* Python is the language batou uses. This is not to be
  confused with the Python that your application might use.
* We expect little from the remote environments
  regarding software dependencies: Python 2.7,  OpenSSH, and rsync, Mercurial or git should be sufficient.
* batou does not become an active component during your
  application's runtime. batou automates what a sysadmin would do -- in a structured manner.
* It should be easy to switch between the declarative
  part of the model and the imperative implementation.
* Implementations that become too complicated
  should be easy to break up into simpler ones.
* batou is not intended to perform provisioning or
  system configuration tasks. We expect the heavy lifting (preparing the target OS) to already be done.
* batou should be working with your applications without
  too many hassles.
* We want to make things simple for you but we do
  not insulate you in ways that make you blind.
