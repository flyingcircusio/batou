Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

batou was developed with a number of ideas in mind:

* Deploying should always be just a single command.
* Python is the language batou uses. In case that you use Python to write
  your application the version of Python that batou runs on is independent
  of the version of Python your application runs with.
* We expect little from the remote environments
  regarding software dependencies: Python 3.5+, OpenSSH, and rsync, Mercurial
  or git are sufficient.
* batou does not become an active component during your
  application's runtime. batou automates what a sysadmin would do -- in a
  repeatable and documented manner.
* It should be easy to switch between the declarative
  part of the model and the imperative implementation.
* Deployment code that becomes too complicated
  should be easy to simplify by breaking it up into smaller pieces.
* batou was not originally intended to perform provisioning or
  system configuration tasks. However, over time this is likely to evolve.
* batou should be working with your existing applications without
  too many hassles.
* No silver bullets: we want to make things simple for you but we do
  not insulate you from hurting yourself completely.

Name

The name "batou" is taken from the animated movie "Ghost in the Shell".

Kudos
-----

batou is built on the shoulders of giants. We're extremely happy to be part
of an active open source community:

* Guido and the Python core developers -- we could not have built this
  without such an awesome language.

* Jim Fulton (@j1mfulton) and zc.buildout -- we love using buildout to create
  Python application environments, but we started having our own ideas at some
  point.

* Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) and the Requests team -- who built the awesome
  requests library. He and his team have brilliant documentation. When it came
  to finally document batou we used their works -- quite literally and
  generously! Everything that is awesome about our documentation stems from
  them. Everything that sucks was caused by us (if you want to help us improve
  -- you're more than welcome!).

* Jeff Forcier (@bitprophet) of Fabric and Paramiko fame -- we've made huge
  advances when we switched from bash scripts to Fabric and kept refactoring
  until our Fabfile slowly turned into batou. We've used Paramiko before
  switching to execnet which gave us a nice way to slowly grow out of Fabric.

* Holger Krekel (@hpk42) who gave us py.test and execnet -- without those
  tools we would not have such a nice test suite and execnet is brilliant for
  lightweight remote Python processing.
