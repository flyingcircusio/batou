Installation
============

batou is installed in each of your projects to ensure that every project is run
with the correct version of batou and possibly other dependencies. Typically
this means you create a new deployment repository for every project.

Starting a new batou project
----------------------------

A new project is started by placing the batou master command into the project and adding that to your repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir myproject
    $ cd myproject
    $ git init
    $ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingcircusio/batou/master/bootstrap | sh
    $ git commit -m "Start a batou project."

Local
-----

To run the batou command on your machine you will need to have the following
dependencies installed:

* Python 3.5+
* OpenSSH
* GPG *(optional, if you want to use encrypted secrets support)*
* Mercurial, git, or rsync *(you only need to have the one installed you actually use to transfer your repository)*

Remote
------

To deploy on a remote server, that server needs to have installed:

* Python 3.5+
* OpenSSH
* Mercurial, git or rsync *(you only need to have the one installed you actually use to transfer your repository)*

Supported Platforms
-------------------

batou is being tested to run on Linux and Mac OS X.

We do *not* support deploying from or to non-UNIX targets.

batou is written in Python and requires to be run with **Python 3.5+**.
