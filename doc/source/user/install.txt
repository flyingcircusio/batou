Installation
============

batou is installed in each of your projects to ensure
that every project is run with the correct version of batou and possibly other dependencies.

Starting a new batou project
----------------------------

A new project is started by placing the batou master command into the project and adding that to your repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir myproject
    $ cd myproject
    $ git init
    $ curl -L https://batou.readthedocs.io/en/latest/batou -o batou
    $ chmod +x batou
    $ ./batou
    Preparing virtualenv in .batou ...
    Pre-installing batou - this can take a while...
