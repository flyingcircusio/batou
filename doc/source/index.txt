batou is a tool that makes it easy to define automated service deployments for
complex (web) applications. It is written by the guys at `gocept
<http://gocept.com>`_ and licensed under the BSD license.

Here is the smallest component and environment definition you can make:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/components/hello/component.py
    :language: python

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/environments/tutorial.cfg
    :language: ini

batou has been conceived after multiple refactorings of complex projects using
Fabric to deploy Python web applications and has been inspired by our previous
experience with Puppet. It specifically aims to make it easy for your
deployments to become idempotent and convergent, two very useful properties for
this kind of work.

This project is still young and being developed very actively - so please be
aware that things may change a lot.  However: all of the code is being used for
our own projects on a daily basis.
