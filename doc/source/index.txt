.. rubric:: Automated application deployment

batou helps you to automate your application deployments:

1. **Create a model of your deployment** (using a simple but powerful Python API)

2. **Describe different environments** (where your model will be deployed on actual machines)

3. **Run the deployment** (using the batou utility)

Getting started with a new project is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir myproject
    $ cd myproject
    $ curl https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/batou/.../bootstrap-template -o batou
    $ chmod +x batou
    $ ./batou

Here's a minimal application model:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p components/myapp
    $ cat > components/myapp/component.py

.. code-block:: python

    from batou.component import Component
    from batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Package
    from batou.lib.supervisor import Program

    class MyApp(Component):

        def configure(self):
            venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
            self += venv
            venv += Package('myapp')
            self += Program('myapp',
                command='bin/myapp')

And here's a minimal environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir environments
    $ cat > environments/dev.cfg

.. code-block:: ini

    [environment]
    mode = local

    [hosts]
    localhost = myapp

To deploy this, you run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./batou deploy dev
