batou is a tool that makes it easy to define excellent automated service
deployments for your applications. It is written by the guys at `gocept
<http://gocept.com>`_ and licensed under the BSD license.

Here is the smallest component and environment definition you can make:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/components/hello/component.py
    :language: python

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/environments/tutorial.cfg
    :language: ini

batou has been conceived after multiple refactorings of projects using Fabric to
deploy Python web applications and has been inspired by our previous experience
with Puppet. It specifically aims to make it easy for your deployments to
become idempotent and convergent, two very useful properties for this kind of
work.

batou is still young and being developed very actively - so please be aware
that things may change a lot.  However: all of the code is being used for our
own projects on a daily basis.
