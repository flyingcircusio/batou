.. rubric:: multi-(component | host | environment | platform) deployment

batou is a tool that makes it easy to define automated service deployments for
complex (web) applications. It is written by the guys at `gocept
<http://gocept.com>`_ and licensed under the BSD license.

Here is the smallest component and environment definition you can make:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/components/hello/component.py
    :language: python

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tutorial-helloworld/environments/tutorial.cfg
    :language: ini

batou was created by extracting our experience with automated deployments for
complex projects. We have used Fabric previously and are happy users of Puppet
for system configuration.  We want to make it easy for you to have deployment
automation that is idempotent and convergent -- two very useful properties
for this kind of work.

This project is still young and being developed very actively -- so please be
aware that things may change a lot.  However: all of the code is being used for
our own projects on a daily basis.
