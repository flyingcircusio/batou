Release v\ |version|.

batou is a BSD licensed utility, written in Python, to configure
development and production environments for web applications.

Deployments are hard and complicated. Tools like Docker, Puppet, chef, and
others exist that try to solve this problem once and for all. However, they
usually need you to change your workflow or toolchain massively while still
missing important steps.

batou makes deployments more bearable without requiring developers to change
their applications. It provides a "one command" approach that should never
need additional wrapper scripts.

As a developer all you ever have to run after cloning or updating your project
is:

.. code-block:: console

 $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/example/myproject
 $ cd myproject
 $ ./batou deploy dev

To run a production deployment all you should ever have to run is:

.. code-block:: console

 $ cd my-project
 $ git pull
 $ ./batou deploy prod

Writing a deployment with batou is a two step process:

Step 1: Model your application's configuration
----------------------------------------------

With our component model you write a configuration specification in Python
based on a simple API. Components make configuration `convergent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(logic)>`_ and `idempotent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence>`_
and using Python lets you perform any computation you need. The component
model is recursive, so you can refactor complicated components into simpler
ones without breaking your setup.

Here is an example application model that installs a Python package into a
VirtualEnv and asks Supervisor to run it:

.. code-block:: python

  from batou.component import Component
  from batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Package
  from batou.lib.supervisor import Program

  class MyApp(Component):

    def configure(self):
      venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
      self += venv
      venv += Package('myapp')
      self += Program('myapp', command='bin/myapp')

Step 2: Fit your model to your environments
-------------------------------------------

Your model from step 1 is abstract: it does not mention the names of the
servers you deploy to.

By describing an environment you tell batou how your abstract model should
actually be applied: on your local development machine, to a vagrant setup, or
on servers on the network.

Here's an environment specification that sets up an application on multiple
hosts and provides an override for the publicly visible address.

.. code-block:: ini

    [environment]
    host_domain = fcio.net

    [host:host01]
    components = nginx, haproxy, varnish

    [host:host02]
    components = myapp

    [host:host03]
    components = myapp

    [host:host04]
    components = postgresql

    [component:nginx]
    server_name = staging.example.com

Features
--------

* Run the same command to deploy locally, to Vagrant, or to remote clusters.
* Use different versions of batou in different projects. Ensure everybody uses the same version.
* Check before deploying whether your configuration is internally consistent and consistent with what has been deployed before.
* Convergent, idempotent components are fast to deploy.
* Resume partial deployments where they were aborted.
* Store database passwords, SSH keys, SSL certificates or other secret data with on the-fly decryption. Manage access to secrets per environment and user.
* Use Jinja2 templates to easily create dynamic configuration.
* Dynamically connect services during deployments and track their dependencies.
* Few run-time requirements on your servers: only Python 2.7 and SSH are needed.
* Use pre-defined components to manage files, python environments, supervisor, cronjobs, and more.
* Writing your own components is easy and you can use  additional Python package dependencies.
