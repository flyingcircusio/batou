Platform varations (TBD)

Generic Debian system
---------------------

batou has some support to interface with a Debian operating system (the
principle should work for other distributions just as well, but since some
paths might be distribution-specific, it's better to be specific).

Setting the platform to ``debian`` in an environment includes the following
functionality:

* Install a generated crontab as the service user's crontab
* Start supervisor after reboot (via cronjob)

Note: There are some features that batou's ``@platform`` mechanism does not
support yet, but which you can access by importing ``Supervisor`` and
``Logrotate`` from ``batou.lib.debian`` instead of their usual module:

* Set a usable path for supervisord's pidfile
* Set up sensible logrotate configuration defaults
* Add our own logrotate cronjob, so we don't need to write to
  ``/etc/logrotate.d``


Vagrant
-------

For developing vagrant is very handy. Batou supports vagrant and developing with the following settings in your development environment::

    [environment]
    service_user = vagrant
    connect_method = vagrant
    update_method = rsync
    platform = vagrant

For a simple, default Vagrant setup, you only use `default` as hostname::

    [hosts]
    default = component1, component2, component3
