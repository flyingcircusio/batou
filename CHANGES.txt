====================
Change log for batou
====================

0.1.5 (unreleased)
==================

- Speed up deployments by improving the logic if bootstraps are required. Now
  bootstrap is left out if not required in most cases.


0.1.4 (2013-02-07)
==================

- Always use a fixed locale of en_US.utf8 so that output from external commands
  remains predictable (RT 86245).
- (Re-)run bootstrap if buildout.cfg or any file in versions is newer than
  bin/buildout. This helps to keep buildout up-to-date.


0.1.3 (2012-10-15)
==================

- Leave umask alone. If it must be set for service deployment, we'd better
  resort to .bashrc or similar.
- Improve EXEC_PREFIX detection code to work with both Python 2 and Python 3
  target versions.


0.1.2 (2012-04-12)
==================

- `self.config_attr('attribute', 'list')` syntax for list-valued types in
  configuration files.
- Call `setlocale` at batou-local startup to initialize locale settings
  throughout component execution.


0.1.1 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Add support for global find-links in Buildout. If a secret
  [buildout]find-links is found, it will be put in component.find_links.


0.1p2 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Packaging fix: include test fixtures to enable running tests on
  installed eggs.


0.1p1 (2012-04-02)
==================

- Correct packaging bugs: missing .txt files etc.
- Unify license to state 'ZPL' consistently in all places. We used to
  have a mix of ZPL/BSD license statements.


0.1 (2012-04-02)
================

initial release
