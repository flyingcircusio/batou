1.1.0a2 (2015-09-03)
====================

- Fix updating from Batou 1.0


1.1.0a1 (2015-09-03)
====================

- Do request an update for packages installed from requirements.txt within
  the batou environment to help update VCS checkouts that are pinned.

- Clear PYTHONPATH for bootstrapping to avoid accidental interaction with
  unclean Python environments.

- Provide '--fast' mode: do not perform bootstrapping.

  This is a first step to improve bootstrapping times. The switch is rather dumb but allows us to work a) offline
  in some cases and b) develop faster.

- Fix unicode encoding/decoding in File handling. See #14944.
  (Ported from 1.0)

- Fold the runner invocation for `local` and `remote` into
  a single `deploy` command:

  $ ./batou deploy <environment>

  To force a local or remote invocation use --local and --remote. By default batou will assume a remote environment. To configure an environment's deployment mode use the `mode` attribute in the `environment` section::

      [environment]
      mode = local

  To specify a manual override on the commandline you can provide the `--local` or `--remote` arguments to the `run` command.

- Improve bootstrapping to give developers a better way
  to get started without installing batou system-wide
  or in a temporary virtualenv.

- Revamp README and documentation.

- Rework error handling and output management.

  batou will now show more errors at once, suppress unnecessary internal tracebacks and try to prioritize
  different errors to make complex failure situations
  easier to ingest.
