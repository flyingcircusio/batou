Changelog
=========

1.3.1 (2016-10-13)
==================

- Bug fix: Don't update virtualenv on each run. (#23983)


1.3.0 (2016-09-12)
==================

- Update virtualenv when the Python version changes (#22805)

- Remove support for virtualenv with Python 2.4, 2.5 and 3.2.

- Add way to set arbitrary environment variables in crontab.

- Fix performance issue with git and mercurial Clone components.


1.3b3 (2016-05-30)
==================

- Fix a crash in case of GnuPG2 is not installed at all.


1.3b2 (2016-05-27)
==================

- Parallelize connect to remote hosts and bootstrapping of remote batou via
  `./batou deploy`.

- Support remote host/port for MySQL commands.

- Copy virtualenv files instead of symlinking (for Python 2.7 and up).
  Symlinking breaks especially on NixOS since the symlinks point directly to
  the store.

- Hide passwords from output of the `Download` component.

- Add `dependencies` to `supervisor.Program`.

- Fix disconnect error in consistency check.

- Support gpg2.

- Download virtualenv via PIP. This fixes an error caused by the PyPI
  restructuring

1.3b1 (2016-03-09)
==================

- Provided extended prediction support for deployments. In addition to ``-c``
  which checks internal consistency of the configuration model you can pass
  ``-P`` which causes verification to be run and predict which changes
  will be applied when deploying.

- Enhance support for multi-line members in secret files: order them and
  indent them automatically. (#13040)

1.2 (2016-01-29)
================

- Change default of supervisor PID file path to ensure it does something
  useful out of the box.

  It's still a good idea to place it on a temporary filesystem that is wiped
  after a reboot to ensure the PID is from a current system environment.


1.2b2 (2016-01-29)
==================

- Remove the deprecated 'remote' command alias.

- Remove implicit dependency of Supervisor to Logrotation and Nagios.

  Supervisor now has the options ``logrotate`` and ``nagios`` that can
  be enabled per environment.

  **Compatibility note:** if you update from an existing setup with supervisor
  you should add this to your environments that actually use those features::

    [component:supervisor]
    logrotate = True
    nagios = True

  Otherwise environments will complain that the RotatedLogFile and
  nagios.Service have unsatisfied resource requirements. Alternatively you
  can drop the ``logrotate`` and ``nrpehost`` or ``nagiosserver`` components
  in environments where you don't need them.

1.2b1 (2016-01-28)
==================

- Add more utilities for managing secrets: get an overview of
  all environments and what user keys are there, automatically
  add or remove users to all, one, or multiple environments.

- Improve component error reporting.

- Add '--check' flag to deploy command. This causes batou to connect only
  to the first host and report any configuration errors.

  The target will have their batou repository updated, so here's a friendly
  reminder that your deployment should not depend on the content of the
  repository directly but always only on things copied to the work environment.

- Make the '--fast' and '-F' flags more robust.

- Fix up some outdated examples (not all of them, though).

- Fix configuration error reporting. Removing some code that would
  never get run. Do not report configuration errors as deployment errors.

- Display ignored hosts during connection sequence to make numbers add
  up and clarify what's going on.

1.1.2 (2016-01-20)
==================

- Improve error reporting for crontab component.

- Fix error ordering.

- Introduce syntax to disable deployment of hosts and components.
  Prefix a hostname with '!' or a component name with '!' to have
  it configured but not deployed. This supports temporary adjustments
  while keeping a consistent config.

  We mark this red in the output because this really needs to be used
  carefully.

  It replaces the approach in batou 1.0 where one would set up dummy
  hosts and use "batou local dev localhost".

1.1.1 (2016-01-11)
==================

- Fix supervisor's buildout dependency to avoid non-convergence of
  the pip-installed package.

1.1 (2016-01-03)
================

- Fix Debian supervisor's pid file attribute.

- Update supervisor to 3.2.


1.1.0a12 (2015-11-24)
=====================

- Fix curl initial bootstrap.

- Allow to set the contact group of the Supervisor service check from
  the environment::

    [component:supervisor]
    check_contact_groups = group1, group2


1.1.0a11 (2015-11-24)
=====================

- Allow to set the contact group of the Supervisor service check.


1.1.0a10 (2015-11-11)
=====================

- Sort logfiles for logrotate to avoid superfluous reloading.


1.1.0a9 (2015-10-14)
====================

- Do not implicitly perform attribute conversions when applying overrides.
  Due to the behaviour of `hasattr` this shadowed conversion exceptions
  and also performed unnecessary computation or network access (e.g. DNS).


1.1.0a8 (2015-10-05)
====================

- Fix default pip arguments for installing packages. This stops rebuilds of
  python/buildout components on each run.

- Change default virtualenv download URL to https and use the current FCIO
  mirror.


1.1.0a7 (2015-09-18)
====================

- Support Git < 2.0

- Add support for managing Python 3.5 environments.

- Update virtualenv to newest version for Python 2.7+ and all
  Python 3 versions.

- Drop support for Python 3.1.

- Update supervisor: 3.0 -> 3.1.3

  Includes updated dependencies.

- Make socketpath in supervisor configurable.

- Fix broken Python compatibility tests.


1.1.0a6 (2015-09-17)
====================

- Adjust Git repositories to correctly perform fast-forward
  merges.

- Fix Mercurial repository tests that broke without noticing.

- Add end-to-end test for our new error reporting which got a
  regression (#17617)

1.1.0a5 (2015-09-09)
====================

- Fix Mercurial repositories after refactorings for Git broke it.


1.1.0a4 (2015-09-06)
====================

- Actually get pull-based Git repositories to work. Still experimental, though.


1.1.0a3 (2015-09-05)
====================

- Initial support for managing batou projects with git. Git repositories
  support pull-based and bundle-based shipping.

- Add backwards compatibility for `batou remote` to help users
  migrate their fingers.

1.1.0a2 (2015-09-03)
====================

- Fix updating from Batou 1.0


1.1.0a1 (2015-09-03)
====================

- Do request an update for packages installed from requirements.txt within
  the batou environment to help update VCS checkouts that are pinned.

- Clear PYTHONPATH for bootstrapping to avoid accidental interaction with
  unclean Python environments.

- Provide '--fast' mode: do not perform bootstrapping.

  This is a first step to improve bootstrapping times. The switch is rather dumb but allows us to work a) offline
  in some cases and b) develop faster.

- Fix unicode encoding/decoding in File handling. See #14944.
  (Ported from 1.0)

- Fold the runner invocation for `local` and `remote` into
  a single `deploy` command:

  $ ./batou deploy <environment>

  By default batou will assume a remote environment. To configure an environment's deployment mode use the `connect_method` attribute in the `environment` section::

      [environment]
      connect_method = local

- Improve bootstrapping to give developers a better way
  to get started without installing batou system-wide
  or in a temporary virtualenv.

- Revamp README and documentation.

- Rework error handling and output management.

  batou will now show more errors at once, suppress unnecessary internal tracebacks and try to prioritize
  different errors to make complex failure situations
  easier to ingest.
