=========
Changelog
=========

1.0.10 (2016-06-03)
===================

- Download virtualenv via PIP. This fixes an error caused by the PyPI
  restructuring


1.0.9 (2016-01-03)
==================

- Work around broken crontab setuid installations by passing the
  new crontab via stdin.

- Fix accidental conversions for component attribute defaults: avoid
  conversions if we have overrides.

- Fix Debian supervisor's pid file attribute.

1.0.8 (2015-05-06)
==================

- Update built-in requests version to avoid certificate issues with
  newer Python 2.7.


1.0.7 (2015-05-04)
==================

- Improve Vagrant support: automatically install crontabs and automatically
  start services on boot.


1.0.6 (2015-04-01)
==================

- Add "dirty" flag to dependencies to express that it's OK to work with
  dirty data, e.g. to simply do a one-time retrieval, as long as we get
  _something_ back. Useful to peek onto static values like overrides or
  configuration when otherwise confronted with circular dependencies.


1.0.5 (2015-03-31)
==================

- Fix unicode accident: shells with ASCII only failed to run the
  supervisor cold deployment log message.


1.0.4 (2015-03-31)
==================

- A new event handling system that allows intercepting and responding
  to events from components. Currently supports "before-update".

- Supplement supervisor programs with 'deployment' mode parameter
  to support 'cold' deployments that shut down programs before
  any updates get deployed without causing superfluous cycles.


1.0.3 (2015-03-18)
==================

- Fix unicode encoding/decoding in File handling. See #14944.

- Remove remnant of better error output that got deferred to the 1.1
  branch that breaks reporting any conversion errors at all.

1.0.2 (2015-02-27)
==================

- Fix a bundle shipping issue: incorrect language settings caused us to
  incorrectly parse the list of heads on the remote side.


1.0.1 (2015-02-26)
==================

- Add virtualenv metadata for Python 2.4
- Keep trailing newlines when rendering templates


1.0 (2015-02-10)
================

- Add 'connect_method = vagrant' to the environment if you want to deploy
  into vagrant and use the 'vagrant ssh' invocation.

- Update internal buildout, setuptools, and execnet versions.

- Add 'update_method = rsync' to provide a simple, non-VCS specific way
  of shipping batou definitions to the remote side. This does not perform
  any conflict resolution and is mainly intended for use with vagrant.

- Supervisor: Assert that a Program should get to state "RUNNING" within
  ``startsecs`` after restarting, instead of only waiting for ``startsecs``.


1.0b33 (2015-01-28)
===================

- Fix bug in git Clone: Directly after cloning there is nothing to merge,
  so don't attempt to.


1.0b32 (2015-01-22)
===================

- Fix custom MySQL admin user when executing SQL statements.


1.0b31 (2015-01-16)
===================

- Rename a variable in ServiceCheck that conflicted with NRPEService and
  prevented custom naming of NRPE checks.


1.0b30 (2015-01-09)
===================

- A special case in error reporting caused `batou local` to exit silently
  on an error.

- Provide an easier to read error message when encountering non-converging
  working sets.

- Provide an easier to read error message when encountering cycles
  in the component dependencies.

- Fix bug in git Clone that caused breakage during update() when a fixed
  revision was specified.


1.0b29 (2014-12-12)
===================

- Make target directory on remote side configurable via
  Environment.target_directory (default is ``~/deployment``).

- Improve installation documentation w.r.t more specific instructions for
  various Linux distributions (deb- and rpm-based).

- Change mode of files before changing content to allow self-fixing broken
  modes.

- Allow deleting symlinks (on OS X) if they point to directorys.


1.0b28 (2014-10-10)
===================

- batou bootstrap script is more roboust now for cases where the virtualenv becomes
  broken.


1.0b27 (2014-09-15)
===================

- Do not configure environments locally when running remote deployments. Use
  order as determined by one reference remote host. #13530

- Nagios configuration now supports contact groups.


1.0b26 (2014-08-05)
===================

- Enhance git Clone component to support the full suite of functionality the
  mercurial one has (incoming/outgoing/local changes etc.).

  NOTE: This changes ``batou.lib.git.Clone`` in backward-incompatible ways:

  1. The namevar is now only the ``url``. The previously also accepted usage
     of passing the ``target`` as the namevar no longer works.
  2. ``update_unpinned`` is gone, use the ``branch``/``revision``/``vcs_update``
     mechanism instead.


1.0b25 (2014-07-31)
===================

- Improve gpg handling: don't do --no-tty or --batch any longer as we actually
  only run the gpg code in (local) terminal environments usually.


1.0b24 (2014-07-04)
===================

- Actually fix unzipping.

- Remove environment option ``connect_method``, and use autodetection instead:
  If we're not the configured ``service_user`` after the plain ssh connect,
  run sudo.

- Refactor attributes and overrides: attributes allow template expansion now
  and also converting default values. The Attribute class has moved to the
  batou component module.

- Yield nonzero returncode on remote exceptions.

- Add convenience converter for attributes "list" to handle comma separated
  lists of strings.

- Force safety of Nagios service description field: prohibit "," as its not
  safe for Nagios business processes.

- Allow specifying custom rsync options for SyncDir: the '--inplace' option
  is a good idea in most cases, but not all. Fixes #11846.

- Make supervisor restart/reload more robust towards non-running supervisors
  with lying PID files. Fixes #12744.

- Remove harmful decoding step in File verify that caused wrong results.


1.0b23 (2014-06-30)
===================

- Allow unzip to overwrite existing files if the archive has newer copies.


1.0b22 (2014-06-30)
===================

- Fix uncaught import-error on mysql module.


1.0b21 (2014-06-30)
===================

- Fix bug in bundle shipping that made batou depend on the locale (#13465).

- Add MySQL components.

- Introduce batou.utils.Attribute() to avoid imperative type conversions in
  configure().

1.0b20 (2014-05-13)
===================

- Start using python-requests for HTTP/S downloads to support authentication
  (and other goodies).

- Improve error logging.


1.0b19 (2014-04-07)
===================

- Allow specifying alternate find-links in requirements.txt

- Remove remnants of the buildout component's ``extends`` option.



1.0b18 (2014-03-31)
===================

- Introduce environment option ``connect_method``, either 'ssh+sudo' (default)
  or plain 'ssh'.

- Improve update code: existing installations would not update cleanly to a new
  version due to wrong use of pkg_resources API.
  Existing installations need to be cleaned manually. :/

- Archive: recognize ``.tar.xz`` files and extract them with ``tar``.

- Fix bug in CMMI verify that would always raise UpdateNeeded due to a path
  mismatch (#13145).

- Component.cmd() now performs expand() on the given command by
  default. Saves typing:

    self.cmd('rm -rf {{component.workdir}}')

  instead of

    self.cmd(self.expand('rm -rf {{component.workdir}}'))

- File component: apply character encoding when reading and writing files.
  (#13165)

- Mercurial clone: changed update behaviour yet again: unless configured
  differently, always achieve target state, even by losing uncommitted changes.

- Allow unnamed access to the last added/ored component using the
  'self._' attribute:

  def configure(self):
      self += Download(...)
      self += Extract(self._.target)


1.0b17 (2013-12-06)
===================

- Mercurial clone: refuse to update if there are uncommitted changes or
  outgoing changesets.

- Mercurial clone: added an option to avoid updating existing clones, which is
  often desirable during development.


1.0b16 (2013-11-29)
===================

- Improve the bootstrap/upgrade fix for #13049: the bootstrap template needed a
  second improvement.

1.0b15 (2013-11-29)
===================

- Try to fix #13049 - will only work once the dev version is already at least
  at b15. Not sure whether it really does the job, though. Hard to test.

- Make environment and host arguments for running ``batou local`` optional.
  ``dev`` and ``localhost`` are the defaults now. Fixes #13034

- Allow specifying secrets with [component:xy] in addition to [xy] to make it
  easier to discover when used to the environment overrides. Both options are
  supported now. Fixes #13003

- Refactor Python virtualenv and package management. Provide explicit knowledge
  about Python versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 to use compatible
  virtualenv/pip/setuptools versions and commands. Fixes #12941

  NOTE: The API for batou.lib.python.Package has changed in
  backwards-incompatible ways:

  Package() needs to be added to a VirtualEnv component. Before::

    self += VirtualEnv(...)
    self += Package(...)

  Now::

    venv = VirtualEnv(...)
    self += venv
    venv += Package(...)

  Package parameter ``pip_install_options`` has been renamed to
  ``install_options``.

- Use ``urllib`` module instead of ``wget`` command for cross platform
  compatibility.


1.0b14 (2013-11-26)
===================

- Make Buildout component install zc.buildout without dependencies (which is
  just setuptools), since that can break the version pinning of setuptools.

- Check whether packages required via a ``-e`` expression in the local
  ``requirements.txt`` are already installed.

- #12946: Make full path to python executable configurable for virtualenv
  (and buildout) component.

- Remove cleanup code that removes batou-0.2-style virtualenv directories (bin,
  lib, include etc.) from remote deployments.

- Add mailto setting to crontab component.

- Added some documentation.


1.0b13 (2013-11-19)
===================

- Introduce a plugin mechanism: if a local ``requirements.txt`` file is
  present, install its contents into the ``.batou`` virtualenv.

- Load components in alphabetical order. This enables importing from other
  components (when naming the directories appropriately).

- #12986: Only try to unbundle if there actually are changes to unbundle.

- Raise an error if a cron job is configured without a timing value.

- Add platform support for Debian (crontab, logrotate, supervisor).

- Added some documentation.


1.0b12 (2013-11-04)
===================

- Added ``branch`` argument to ``mercurial.Clone``. Setting a branch
  automatically updates to the branch head on deploy. This is mostly useful for
  development environments.

- Create the 'secrets' directory if it doesn't exist, yet. Also, disallow
  editing secret files for non-existing environments.

- Support continuing remote bootstrapping if we failed after creating the
  initial remote directory but were unable to use Mercurial.

- #12898: build.Configure component was broken when using the default
  prefix.


1.0b11 (2013-10-17)
===================

- #12897: Use non-SSL pypi mirror for downloading virtualenv to fix tests
  failing randomly on machines that (for some reason) can't validate PyPI's
  certificate.

- #12911: Ensure that we can configure file owners when they don't
  exist during configure phase yet.

- #12912: Fix untested and broken file ownership management.

- #12847: Clean up unicode handling for File and Content components and
  templating.

- #12910: Remote deployments failed when using bundles for transfers if no
  changes needed bundling.

- #12766: Allow bootstrapping a batou project in an existing directory to
  support migration from 0.2.

- #12283: Recognize files as 'is_template' by default. Auto-detect source files
  in the definition directory if they have the same basename. This is what you
  want in 99% of all cases. Explicitly stating either the 'content' or 'source'
  parameter disables auto-detection.

  Now you can write this:

  File('foo')

  and have `components/x/foo` recognized as the source file and handled as a
  template.

- Use ConfigParser instead of configobj which is effectively unmaintained
  (see https://twitter.com/voidspace/status/380699699042213889) and support
  lists separated by newlines in addition to commas.


1.0b10 (2013-09-27)
===================

- Package our own virtualenv instead of depending on the system-installed one.
  This should alleviate troubles due to old virtualenv versions that package
  ``distribute``, which causes conflicts with recent ``setuptools`` versions
  (#12874).

- Update supervisor version to 3.0.


1.0b9 (2013-08-22)
==================

- Update Package component so it ignores installed packages when installing.
  This way, we actually install setuptools even when distribute is installed.
  (Otherwise it's a no-op since distribute tells pip that setuptools is
  already satisfied).

- Fix update process: wrong call to old '.batou/bin/batou' failed and early
  bootstrapping would downgrade temporarily which is confusing and superfluous.
  Fixes #12739.

1.0b8 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Remove superfluous mkdir call during remote bootstrap.

- Make ``batou init`` print that it's working. Bootstrapping can take a while,
  so at least signal that something's going on.


1.0b7 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Depend on Python2.7 to be available on the PATH during early bootstrap.
  Otherwise our chances to get a 2.7 virtualenv are pretty small, too.

- Improve project template: ignore the work/ directory by default.


1.0b6 (2013-08-17)
==================

- More MANIFEST inclusions: bootstrap-template.


1.0b5 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Improve MANIFEST so we actually package the init template and other generated
  files, like version.txt and requirements.txt.

1.0b4 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Provide a simple project-creation command, both for pip-installed batou's as
  well as spawning new projects from existing ones. Fixes #12730

- Fix #12679: make timeouts configurable.

- Removed re-imports from batou main module to support light-weight
  self-installation and bootstrapping. I.e. 'from batou import Component' no
  longer works.

- Provide a single main command together with a 'bootstrap' wrapper that you
  can check into your project and that is maintained during updates
  automatically. It also provides fully automatic bootstrapping, installation,
  upgrading and other maintenance.

- Fix Python package installation version check.

- Don't use `bin/buildout bootstrap` command anymore. PIP installs a sufficient
  `bin/buildout` so buildout can do the rest internally.

- Install zc.buildout during bootstrapping phase using PIP to avoid
  bootstrap.py problems.

- Shorten URLs in the Build component to their basename.

- Add 'assert_cmd' API to support simpler assertions for verify when needing to
  check the result of an external command.

- Switch to asking pip installing eggs instead of flat installations as
  namespaces seem to collide otherwise.

- Remove non-functional deprecated 'md5sum' attribute.

- Components are context managers now. If you provide __enter__ it will be
  called before verify() and if you provide __exit__ this will be called after
  update (always - even if update isn't actually called). This allows you to
  manage temporary state on the target system more gracefully. See the
  DMGExtractor for an example.

- Major refactoring of internal data structures to simplify and improve test
  coverage. Some breakage to be expected:

  * Components do not have a 'service' attribute any longer. If you need access
    to the service base directory use 'environment.base_dir'.

- Another attempt at getting convergency for package installation: actually
  leverage pkg_resources to check what version of a package is installed. PIP
  does not necessarily list or freeze setuptools, even if forced to reinstall.

- Remove superfluous '--update' from pip calls that would temporarily install
  the incorrect package version.

- Improve convenience of the 'secrets-edit' wrapper script to allow
  re-encrypting without re-entering the editor.

- Consistently switch to using setuptools.

- Fix #12399: incorrect stat attributes for Owner and Group

- Add ``exclude`` parameter to Directory component.

- Add ``env`` parameter to ``Component.cmd()`` (and corresponding
  ``build_environment`` parameter to the Build component) to allow
  adding/overriding environment variables.


1.0b3 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Enable logging in the remote core to see what's going on on the remote side.

- Try to better format exceptions from the remote side.

- Try harder to get virtualenv back into a working state.

- Allow remote deployments from root of repository.

- Make PIP management more robust.

1.0b2 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Add component to manage PIP within a virtual env.

- Add component to manage packages with PIP within a virtual env.

- Restructure buildout component to make it more robust regarding
  setuptools/distribute preparation. Also remove usage of bootstrap completely
  as we rely on virtualenv anyway.


1.0b1 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Apply semantic versioning: initial development is over, so this is 1.0 now.

- Major revamp of secrets management:

  - switch to GPG (instead of aespipe)

  - turn secrets into a core feature, removing the need for a special component

- Add '--single' to suppress parallel bootstrapping.
