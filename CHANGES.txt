Changelog
=========

1.0b16 (2013-11-29)
===================

- Improve the bootstrap/upgrade fix for #13049: the bootstrap template needed a
  second improvement.

1.0b15 (2013-11-29)
===================

- Try to fix #13049 - will only work once the dev version is already at least
  at b15. Not sure whether it really does the job, though. Hard to test.

- Make environment and host arguments for running ``batou local`` optional.
  ``dev`` and ``localhost`` are the defaults now. Fixes #13034

- Allow specifying secrets with [component:xy] in addition to [xy] to make it
  easier to discover when used to the environment overrides. Both options are
  supported now. Fixes #13003

- Refactor Python virtualenv and package management. Provide explicit knowledge
  about Python versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 to use compatible
  virtualenv/pip/setuptools versions and commands. Fixes #12941

- Use ``urllib`` module instead of ``wget`` command for cross platform
  compatibility.


1.0b14 (2013-11-26)
===================

- Make Buildout component install zc.buildout without dependencies (which is
  just setuptools), since that can break the version pinning of setuptools.

- Check whether packages required via a ``-e`` expression in the local
  ``requirements.txt`` are already installed.

- #12946: Make full path to python executable configurable for virtualenv
  (and buildout) component.

- Remove cleanup code that removes batou-0.2-style virtualenv directories (bin,
  lib, include etc.) from remote deployments.

- Add mailto setting to crontab component.

- Added some documentation.


1.0b13 (2013-11-19)
===================

- Introduce a plugin mechanism: if a local ``requirements.txt`` file is
  present, install its contents into the ``.batou`` virtualenv.

- Load components in alphabetical order. This enables importing from other
  components (when naming the directories appropriately).

- #12986: Only try to unbundle if there actually are changes to unbundle.

- Raise an error if a cron job is configured without a timing value.

- Add platform support for Debian (crontab, logrotate, supervisor).

- Added some documentation.


1.0b12 (2013-11-04)
===================

- Added ``branch`` argument to ``mercurial.Clone``. Setting a branch
  automatically updates to the branch head on deploy. This is mostly useful for
  development environments.

- Create the 'secrets' directory if it doesn't exist, yet. Also, disallow
  editing secret files for non-existing environments.

- Support continuing remote bootstrapping if we failed after creating the
  initial remote directory but were unable to use Mercurial.

- #12898: build.Configure component was broken when using the default
  prefix.


1.0b11 (2013-10-17)
===================

- #12897: Use non-SSL pypi mirror for downloading virtualenv to fix tests
  failing randomly on machines that (for some reason) can't validate PyPI's
  certificate.

- #12911: Ensure that we can configure file owners when they don't
  exist during configure phase yet.

- #12912: Fix untested and broken file ownership management.

- #12847: Clean up unicode handling for File and Content components and
  templating.

- #12910: Remote deployments failed when using bundles for transfers if no
  changes needed bundling.

- #12766: Allow bootstrapping a batou project in an existing directory to
  support migration from 0.2.

- #12283: Recognize files as 'is_template' by default. Auto-detect source files
  in the definition directory if they have the same basename. This is what you
  want in 99% of all cases. Explicitly stating either the 'content' or 'source'
  parameter disables auto-detection.

  Now you can write this:

  File('foo')

  and have `components/x/foo` recognized as the source file and handled as a
  template.

- Use ConfigParser instead of configobj which is effectively unmaintained
  (see https://twitter.com/voidspace/status/380699699042213889) and support
  lists separated by newlines in addition to commas.


1.0b10 (2013-09-27)
===================

- Package our own virtualenv instead of depending on the system-installed one.
  This should alleviate troubles due to old virtualenv versions that package
  ``distribute``, which causes conflicts with recent ``setuptools`` versions
  (#12874).

- Update supervisor version to 3.0.


1.0b9 (2013-08-22)
==================

- Update Package component so it ignores installed packages when installing.
  This way, we actually install setuptools even when distribute is installed.
  (Otherwise it's a no-op since distribute tells pip that setuptools is
  already satisfied).

- Fix update process: wrong call to old '.batou/bin/batou' failed and early
  bootstrapping would downgrade temporarily which is confusing and superfluous.
  Fixes #12739.

1.0b8 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Remove superfluous mkdir call during remote bootstrap.

- Make ``batou init`` print that it's working. Bootstrapping can take a while,
  so at least signal that something's going on.


1.0b7 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Depend on Python2.7 to be available on the PATH during early bootstrap.
  Otherwise our chances to get a 2.7 virtualenv are pretty small, too.

- Improve project template: ignore the work/ directory by default.


1.0b6 (2013-08-17)
==================

- More MANIFEST inclusions: bootstrap-template.


1.0b5 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Improve MANIFEST so we actually package the init template and other generated
  files, like version.txt and requirements.txt.

1.0b4 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Provide a simple project-creation command, both for pip-installed batou's as
  well as spawning new projects from existing ones. Fixes #12730

- Fix #12679: make timeouts configurable.

- Removed re-imports from batou main module to support light-weight
  self-installation and bootstrapping. I.e. 'from batou import Component' no
  longer works.

- Provide a single main command together with a 'bootstrap' wrapper that you
  can check into your project and that is maintained during updates
  automatically. It also provides fully automatic bootstrapping, installation,
  upgrading and other maintenance.

- Fix Python package installation version check.

- Don't use `bin/buildout bootstrap` command anymore. PIP installs a sufficient
  `bin/buildout` so buildout can do the rest internally.

- Install zc.buildout during bootstrapping phase using PIP to avoid
  bootstrap.py problems.

- Shorten URLs in the Build component to their basename.

- Add 'assert_cmd' API to support simpler assertions for verify when needing to
  check the result of an external command.

- Switch to asking pip installing eggs instead of flat installations as
  namespaces seem to collide otherwise.

- Remove non-functional deprecated 'md5sum' attribute.

- Components are context managers now. If you provide __enter__ it will be
  called before verify() and if you provide __exit__ this will be called after
  update (always - even if update isn't actually called). This allows you to
  manage temporary state on the target system more gracefully. See the
  DMGExtractor for an example.

- Major refactoring of internal data structures to simplify and improve test
  coverage. Some breakage to be expected:

  * Components do not have a 'service' attribute any longer. If you need access
    to the service base directory use 'environment.base_dir'.

- Another attempt at getting convergency for package installation: actually
  leverage pkg_resources to check what version of a package is installed. PIP
  does not necessarily list or freeze setuptools, even if forced to reinstall.

- Remove superfluous '--update' from pip calls that would temporarily install
  the incorrect package version.

- Improve convenience of the 'secrets-edit' wrapper script to allow
  re-encrypting without re-entering the editor.

- Consistently switch to using setuptools.

- Fix #12399: incorrect stat attributes for Owner and Group

- Add ``exclude`` parameter to Directory component.

- Add ``env`` parameter to ``Component.cmd()`` (and corresponding
  ``build_environment`` parameter to the Build component) to allow
  adding/overriding environment variables.


1.0b3 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Enable logging in the remote core to see what's going on on the remote side.

- Try to better format exceptions from the remote side.

- Try harder to get virtualenv back into a working state.

- Allow remote deployments from root of repository.

- Make PIP management more robust.

1.0b2 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Add component to manage PIP within a virtual env.

- Add component to manage packages with PIP within a virtual env.

- Restructure buildout component to make it more robust regarding
  setuptools/distribute preparation. Also remove usage of bootstrap completely
  as we rely on virtualenv anyway.


1.0b1 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Apply semantic versioning: initial development is over, so this is 1.0 now.

- Major revamp of secrets management:

  - switch to GPG (instead of aespipe)

  - turn secrets into a core feature, removing the need for a special component

- Add '--single' to suppress parallel bootstrapping.
