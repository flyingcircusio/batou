Changelog
=========

1.0b9 (unreleased)
==================

- Nothing changed yet.


1.0b8 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Remove superfluous mkdir call during remote bootstrap.

- Make ``batou init`` print that it's working. Bootstrapping can take a while,
  so at least signal that something's going on.


1.0b7 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Depend on Python2.7 to be available on the PATH during early bootstrap.
  Otherwise our chances to get a 2.7 virtualenv are pretty small, too.

- Improve project template: ignore the work/ directory by default.


1.0b6 (2013-08-17)
==================

- More MANIFEST inclusions: bootstrap-template.


1.0b5 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Improve MANIFEST so we actually package the init template and other generated
  files, like version.txt and requirements.txt.

1.0b4 (2013-08-17)
==================

- Provide a simple project-creation command, both for pip-installed batou's as
  well as spawning new projects from existing ones. Fixes #12730

- Fix #12679: make timeouts configurable.

- Removed re-imports from batou main module to support light-weight
  self-installation and bootstrapping. I.e. 'from batou import Component' no
  longer works.

- Provide a single main command together with a 'bootstrap' wrapper that you
  can check into your project and that is maintained during updates
  automatically. It also provides fully automatic bootstrapping, installation,
  upgrading and other maintenance.

- Fix Python package installation version check.

- Don't use `bin/buildout bootstrap` command anymore. PIP installs a sufficient
  `bin/buildout` so buildout can do the rest internally.

- Install zc.buildout during bootstrapping phase using PIP to avoid
  bootstrap.py problems.

- Shorten URLs in the Build component to their basename.

- Add 'assert_cmd' API to support simpler assertions for verify when needing to
  check the result of an external command.

- Switch to asking pip installing eggs instead of flat installations as
  namespaces seem to collide otherwise.

- Remove non-functional deprecated 'md5sum' attribute.

- Components are context managers now. If you provide __enter__ it will be
  called before verify() and if you provide __exit__ this will be called after
  update (always - even if update isn't actually called). This allows you to
  manage temporary state on the target system more gracefully. See the
  DMGExtractor for an example.

- Major refactoring of internal data structures to simplify and improve test
  coverage. Some breakage to be expected:

  * Components do not have a 'service' attribute any longer. If you need access
    to the service base directory use 'environment.base_dir'.

- Another attempt at getting convergency for package installation: actually
  leverage pkg_resources to check what version of a package is installed. PIP
  does not necessarily list or freeze setuptools, even if forced to reinstall.

- Remove superfluous '--update' from pip calls that would temporarily install
  the incorrect package version.

- Improve convenience of the 'secrets-edit' wrapper script to allow
  re-encrypting without re-entering the editor.

- Consistently switch to using setuptools.

- Fix #12399: incorrect stat attributes for Owner and Group

- Add ``exclude`` parameter to Directory component.

- Add ``env`` parameter to ``Component.cmd()`` (and corresponding
  ``build_environment`` parameter to the Build component) to allow
  adding/overriding environment variables.


1.0b3 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Enable logging in the remote core to see what's going on on the remote side.

- Try to better format exceptions from the remote side.

- Try harder to get virtualenv back into a working state.

- Allow remote deployments from root of repository.

- Make PIP management more robust.

1.0b2 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Add component to manage PIP within a virtual env.

- Add component to manage packages with PIP within a virtual env.

- Restructure buildout component to make it more robust regarding
  setuptools/distribute preparation. Also remove usage of bootstrap completely
  as we rely on virtualenv anyway.


1.0b1 (2013-07-09)
==================

- Apply semantic versioning: initial development is over, so this is 1.0 now.

- Major revamp of secrets management:

  - switch to GPG (instead of aespipe)

  - turn secrets into a core feature, removing the need for a special component

- Add '--single' to suppress parallel bootstrapping.


0.2.9 (2013-07-06)
==================

- Fix #12527: utils.cmd breaks on spacey arguments and embedded quotes.

- Avoid accidentally creating incorrect directories in developer VFS mapping.

- Switch testrunner to pytest. Refactor some tests to take advantage of its
  capabilities.

- Clean up PEP8 / pyflakes errors, integrate pytest plugin to ensure continued
  compliance.

- Clean up buildout versions specifications.

- Fix .dmg extractor to copy symlinks as symlinks.

- Fix remote sudo for Mac OS X target hosts.


0.2.8 (2013-06-18)
==================

- Added archive extractor for .dmg files.

- Added flag for supervisor to control whether global or individual restarts
  wait until everything is running.

0.2.7 (2013-05-22)
==================

- Fix template for Nagios check service dependencies.

- Update bootstrap call for batou-internal bootstrapping.

0.2.6 (2013-05-18)
==================

- Add component that clones from a Mercurial repository.

- Write supervisord.pid into /run/local instead of ${workdir}/var to ensure
  correct startup after machine crashes.

- Add `ignore_returncode` parameter to Component.cmd() to suppress exceptions
  on unsuccessful command execution.


0.2.5 (2013-04-23)
==================

- Fix interaction between supervisor programs and disabled supervisors: don't
  try to start those programs.


0.2.4 (2013-04-22)
==================

- Force reread/update on supervisor after config changes.


0.2.3 (2013-04-22)
==================

- supervisor: wait up to 60 seconds instead of 30 until supervisor responds to
  a PID after triggering shutdown. Fix bug trying to detect shutdown:
  RuntimeError would cause residual data in output variables.

- supervisor: after reloading, wait as long as the highest startup delay was
  configured on a program to avoid subsequent accidental restarts.

- supervisor: remove 'restart' flag: always restart if we have a relevant
  change.

- supervisor: fix bug in reload logic: path to supervisord.conf was wrong

0.2.2 (2013-04-19)
==================

- Allow specifying 'configure_args' on cmmi.Build or 'args' on cmmi.Configure.

- Fix supervisor's path lookup for event listeners to support the automatically
  installed superlance plugins better. This may change again in the future
  depending on other event listener needs.


0.2.1 (2013-04-18)
==================

- Fix supervisor refactoring: templates contained static paths from my
  development machine. Event listeners were not formatting the event list
  correctly.

- Let RunningSupervisor wait (infinitely) long when reloading if the
  supervisorctl command returns 'SHUTDOWN_STATE'. This supports large
  installations with many services more gracefully but might get stuck.

- Fix supervisor's Nagios check: I removed the bin/py custom interpreter and
  didn't notice it was used by the check. Put it back.

0.2 (2013-04-18)
================

- Lots of stuff that went on unreleased for way too long. Producing a release
  to allow people to stop running from trunk.

- Buildout component: Allow custom buildout.cfg names and pass the name to
  bootstrap.

- Improve SSH connection error logging: more readable now and hosts are
  identifiable. (#12093)

- Do not automatically add missing SSH host keys any longer. (#11606)

- Use python version specific virtualenv, if availble. This helps with ancient
  Python 2.4 components. For specific virtualenv versions no explicit python
  executable is passed.

- Internalize download hash handling using hashlib. Allow selection of hash
  function. (Thanks to Christine Koppelt.)

- Introduce new component modelling approach.

- Start writing documentation.

- Improve error message when download fails due to checksum mismatch.
